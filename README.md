Note: I haven't had a chance to update this repo for a while, as my startup has been taking off. I will make the time to upgrade these components to Tailwind 2 and Alpine 3 as soon as I can. Sorry all!

# What is Alptail?

Alptail is a collection of open-source UI components, using [Tailwind.css](http://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). Regularly updated and on a mission to make them as accessible as possible. Maintained by [Daniel Palmer](https://www.twitter.com/userlastname).

This static site is built with Tighten's awesome Laravel Blade based [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) generator.

[See a demo of the components here.](https://www.alptail.com/)

## Want to help out?

I maintain Alptail for free in my spare time, for the good of the TALL community. I probably get some stuff wrong, and I definitely could do with help when it comes to accessibility. If you feel like helping contribute to this resource, that's amazing! I've written instructions for how to boot this up on your local here: [See contributing instructions](https://github.com/danieljpalmer/alptail/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

I'll flesh this out in more detail when I get the chance.
